WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello, and welcome to our video.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.000
In this video, we'll show you how to create a WebVTT file.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.000
WebVTT is a format used for displaying timed text tracks.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
It is commonly used for subtitles and captions on the web.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
First, you need to understand the basic structure of a VTT file.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Each caption cue starts with a time range.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
The time range specifies when the text should appear and disappear.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.000
After the time range, you write the text that you want to display.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's add a few more captions to see how it works.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.000
This is another example of a caption cue.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.000
You can also style your captions using HTML tags.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.000
For example, you can make text <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i>.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.000
Thatâ€™s all for this tutorial on WebVTT files.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.000
Thank you for watching, and happy captioning!
